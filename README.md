# Song-Library
Software Methodology class project. 
Java for the backend, FXML for the frontend. 
The Song Library application displays a list of songs' name and its applicable information (author, year, album) in alphabetical order. The application includes 3 features, adding a song, editing a song and deleting a song. Each song is saved as a node in a Linked List. These features are accessible with a button, for add a song and edit a song the user inputs the information into the corresponding textboxes. The application will alert the user if important fields (song name, artist) are left blank, or if there is a duplicate song/artist pairing. On addition, edition and deletion the display will update to show the application changes, keeping with the alphabetical ordering. All of the song information is stored in a text file that is updated upon each action taken. Upon reopening the application songs from the last use will show on the display reflecting the last ordering from the previous session.
